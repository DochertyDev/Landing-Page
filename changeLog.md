## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Consolidated duplicate CSS variables for light and dark themes into a single, well-structured block.
- Removed duplicate `.skills-tags` selector to improve stylesheet maintainability.
- Corrected the scoping of light-mode variables by moving them to the `:root` selector within the corresponding media query.
